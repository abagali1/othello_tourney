# while the binary number with key "1" represents the black bitboard.

# These are helper dictionaries that convert a bitboard with only 1 "on" bit to an integer representing the index of the "on" bit
MOVES = {i: 1 << (63 ^ i) for i in range(64)}
POS = {MOVES[63 ^ i]: 63 ^ i for i in range(64)}
LOG = {MOVES[63 ^ i]: i for i in range(64)}

# What are these dictionaries used for
#
# MOVES: binary numbers are 0 indexed from the right, not the left.
# This dictionary takes in an integer representing an index of a string(i.e left-indexed) and points it to a bitboard with
# the corresponding (right-indexed) bit set.
#
# POS: The opposite of MOVES. Takes in a 64-bit number and points it to an integer representing the index of a string
#
# LOG: This is the equivalent of taking the log2 of the binary number.
# Takes in a 64-bit binary number and points it to the log2 of that number.
#
# HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommend playing around with these dictionaries and bitboards in general to gain a better understanding
